The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the Passwd
Horde password changing application version H4 (4.0-RC1).

Passwd provides support for changing passwords via the Horde authentication
system or various password backends.

Barring any problems, this code will be released as Passwd H4 (4.0).
Testing is requested and comments are encouraged.
Updated translations would also be great.

The following password backends have not been tested with Horde 4 at all yet
and need some testing feedback: Unix expect scripts, the Unix smbpasswd command
for SMB/CIFS passwords, Kolab, ADSI, Pine, Serv-U FTP, VMailMgr, vpopmail.

The major changes compared to Passwd version H4 (4.0-ALPHA1) are:
    * Fixed lookup of user entry in LDAP driver.
    * Updated Estonian translation.
