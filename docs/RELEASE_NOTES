The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first beta release of the Passwd
Horde password changing application version H5 (5.0.0).

Passwd provides support for changing passwords via the Horde authentication
system or various password backends.

The following password backends have not been tested with Horde 4 at all yet
and need some testing feedback: Unix expect scripts, the Unix smbpasswd command
for SMB/CIFS passwords, Kolab, ADSI, Pine, Serv-U FTP, VMailMgr, vpopmail.

The major changes compared to Passwd version H4 are:
    * Updated Japanese translation.
    * Small bugfixes and improvements.
